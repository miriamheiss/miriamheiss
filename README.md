### Hello there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Miriam Heiss! I like [Taylor Swift and Bach](https://www.miriamheiss.com/final-project/), and have been learning the organ for 5 years. I would like to learn CSS and HTML, currently I just know R. My pronouns are She/Her. I currently am working on [PPBDS/primer.tutorials](https://github.com/PPBDS/primer.tutorials). I would like to learn CSS, HTML, and Python. I also have an ever-updating [blog](https://www.miriamheiss.com/).
